## SQL Views

This folder contains the PostgreSQL views used to power the Power BI dashboards in this project.

Each view encapsulates business logic for a specific analytical question, including:
- Revenue trends over time
- Customer lifetime value
- Product performance by artist and genre
- Operational performance of support employees

The views are designed to simplify reporting and keep transformation logic centralized in the database.
